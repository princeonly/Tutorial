Implementation of TabHost in Android 2.2 + ViewPager and Fragments



A sample (and very simple) Project for people like me who had some trouble finding a way
to implement TabHost and ViewPager, including page swiping with fingers and tab click to change pages.
The shown solution is compatible with Android versions 2.2+.

It includes Tabs initialization, ViewPager connected with Tabs and Page Scrolling management.

Its main peculiarity is the optimization for earlier versions of Android 
(FROYO, API version 8, Android 2.2) and the simple implementation for different purposes.

I hope it will be useful.
